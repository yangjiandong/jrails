route
------

   http://cn.asciicasts.com/episodes/203-routing-in-rails-3 

   1. match "/about" => "info#about", :as => :about  
   没有:as参数，这个路由就是单纯的转向”/about”, 加了:as 之后，在我们的应用里面可以使用about_path或者about_url

   2. 更为复杂的可选参数，例如，我们现在有一个博客应用，我们想要在网址中，用可选的年月日来过滤一段特定时间的贴子。
   我们可以用下面的路由达到这个效果，主义括号可以嵌套起来定义多个可选参数。
   match "/:year(/:month(/:day))" => "info#about"  
   在view中，我们添加一些调试信息，来检查传入的参数：

/app/views/info/about.html.erb
<h1>Info#about</h1>  
<p>Find me in app/views/info/about.html.erb</p>  
<%= debug params %>  

   下面，如果我们传入year参数，about动作会收到我们传入的值，month和day参数也是如此

   :constraints可以传入一个hash来限定匹配。以下的例子用四个数字来限定年，两个数字来限定月和日。
   match "/:year(/:month(/:day))" => "info#about", :constraints => { :year => /\d{4}/, :month => /\d{2}/, :day => /\d{2}/ }  
   
   3. 例如，我们可以用user_agent参数来限制一些浏览器的访问，以Firefox为例。
   match "/secret" => "info#about", :constraints => { :user_agent => /Firefox/ }  
   如果我们用Safari, Chrome或者Opera访问页面，我们会看到一个匹配错误。但是Firefox可以正常浏览。

   4. 我们也可以添加一些更有用处的constraint比如主机名。
   match "/secret" => "info#about", :constraints => { :host => /localhost/ }  
   使用这个constraint，我们可以通过http://localhost:3000/secret来浏览网页，但是用ip地址将会返回错误( http://127.0.0.1/secret )，
   
   如果我们有多个路由同时使用一个constraint，会造成很多代码的重复。我们可以用constraints方法把这些路由放到一个块中来降低代码重复。

constraints :host => /localhost/ do  
  match "/secret" => "info#about"  
  match "/topsecret" => "info#about"  
end  

   5.

generator
----------

   1. rails g controller info about

   建立一个info控制器和about动作来展示可选参数。
   Rails 3支持用rails g来作为rails generate的快捷方式。

In short, passing options hash containing
:conditions, :include, :joins, :limit, :offset, :order, :select, :readonly, :group, :having, :from, :lock to any of the ActiveRecord provided class methods, is now deprecated.

Going into details, currently ActiveRecord provides the following finder methods :
find(id_or_array_of_ids, options)
find(:first, options)
find(:all, options)
first(options)
all(options)
update_all(updates, conditions, options)

And the following calculation methods :
count(column, options)
average(column, options)
minimum(column, options)
maximum(column, options)
sum(column, options)
calculate(operation, column, options)

Starting with Rails 3, supplying any option to the methods above will be deprecated.
Support for supplying options will be removed from Rails 3.2. Moreover,
find(:first) and find(:all) ( without any options ) are also being deprecated in favour of first and all.
A tiny little exception here is that count() will still accept a :distinct option.
The following shows a few example of the deprecated usages :

User.find(:all, :limit => 1)
User.find(:all)
User.find(:first)
User.first(:conditions => {:name => 'lifo'})
User.all(:joins => :items)

But the following is NOT deprecated :
User.find(1)
User.find(1,2,3)
User.find_by_name('lifo')

Additionally, supplying options hash to named_scope is also deprecated :
named_scope :red, :conditions => { :colour => 'red' }
named_scope :red, lambda {|colour| {:conditions => { :colour => colour }} }

Supplying options hash to with_scope, with_exclusive_scope and default_scope has also been deprecated :
with_scope(:find => {:conditions => {:name => 'lifo'}) { ... }
with_exclusive_scope(:find => {:limit =>1}) { ... }
default_scope :order => "id DESC"

Dynamic scoped_by_ are also going to be deprecated :
red_items = Item.scoped_by_colour('red')
red_old_items = Item.scoped_by_colour_and_age('red', 2)

New API
ActiveRecord in Rails 3 will have the following new finder methods.
where (:conditions)
having (:conditions)
select
group
order
limit
offset
joins
includes (:include)
lock
readonly
from
1 Value in the bracket ( if different ) indicates the previous equivalent finder option.
Chainability
All of the above methods returns a Relation. Conceptually, a relation is very similar to an anonymous named scope.
All these methods are defined on the Relation object as well, making it possible to chain them.
lifo = User.where(:name => 'lifo')
new_users = User.order('users.id DESC').limit(20).includes(:items)

You could also apply more finders to the existing relations :
cars = Car.where(:colour => 'black')
rich_ppls_cars = cars.order('cars.price DESC').limit(10)

Quacks like a Model
A relation quacks just like a model when it comes to the primary CRUD methods.
You could call any of the following methods on a relation :
new(attributes)
create(attributes)
create!(attributes)
find(id_or_array)
destroy(id_or_array)
destroy_all
delete(id_or_array)
delete_all
update(ids, updates)
update_all(updates)
exists?

So the following code examples work as expected :
red_items = Item.where(:colour => 'red')
red_items.find(1)
item = red_items.new
item.colour #=> 'red'

red_items.exists? #=> true
red_items.update_all :colour => 'black'
red_items.exists? #=> false

Note that calling any of the update or delete/destroy methods would reset the relation, i.e delete the cached records used for optimizing methods like relation.size.

Lazy Loading
As it might be clear from the examples above, relations are loaded lazily – i.e you call an enumerable method on them.
This is very similar to how associations and named_scopes already work.
cars = Car.where(:colour => 'black') # No Query
cars.each {|c| puts c.name } # Fires "select * from cars where ..."

This is very useful along side fragment caching. So in your controller action, you could just do :
def index
  @recent_items = Item.limit(10).order('created_at DESC')
end

And in your view :
<% cache('recent_items') do %>
  <% @recent_items.each do |item| %>
    ...
  <% end %>
<% end %>

In the above example, @recent_items are loaded on @recent_items.each call from the view.
As the controller doesn’t actually fire any query, fragment caching becomes more effective without requiring any special work arounds.
Force loading – all, first & last
For the times you don’t need lazy loading, you could just call all on the relation :

cars = Car.where(:colour => 'black').all

It’s important to note that all returns an Array and not a Relation.
This is similar to how things work in Rails 2.3 with named_scopes and associations.
Similarly, first and last will always return an ActiveRecord object ( or nil ).
cars = Car.order('created_at ASC')
oldest_car = cars.first
newest_car = cars.last
named_scope -> scopes

Using the method named_scope is deprecated in Rails 3.0.
But the only change you’ll need to make is to remove the “named_” part.
Supplying finder options hash will be deprecated in Rails 3.1.
named_scope have now been renamed to just scope.
So a definition like :
class Item
  named_scope :red, :conditions => { :colour => 'red' }
  named_scope :since, lambda {|time| {:conditions => ["created_at > ?", time] }}
end

Now becomes :
class Item
  scope :red, :conditions => { :colour => 'red' }
  scope :since, lambda {|time| {:conditions => ["created_at > ?", time] }}
end

However, as using options hash is going to be deprecated in 3.1, you should write it using the new finder methods :
class Item
  scope :red, where(:colour => 'red')
  scope :since, lambda {|time| where("created_at > ?", time) }
end

Internally, named scopes are built on top of Relation, making it very easy to mix and match them with the finder methods :
red_items = Item.red
available_red_items = red_items.where("quantity > ?", 0)
old_red_items = Item.red.since(10.days.ago)
Model.scoped

If you want to build a complex relation/query, starting with a blank relation, Model.scoped is what you would use.
cars = Car.scoped
rich_ppls_cars = cars.order('cars.price DESC').limit(10)
white_cars = cars.where(:colour => 'red')
Speaking of internals, ActiveRecord::Base has the following delegations :
delegate :find, :first, :last, :all, :destroy, :destroy_all, :exists?, :delete, :delete_all, :update, :update_all, :to => :scoped
delegate :select, :group, :order, :limit, :joins, :where, :preload, :eager_load, :includes, :from, :lock, :readonly, :having, :to => :scoped
delegate :count, :average, :minimum, :maximum, :sum, :calculate, :to => :scoped
The above might give you a better insight on how ActiveRecord is doing things internally. Additionally, dynamic finder methods find_by_name, find_all_by_name_and_colour etc. are also delegated to Relation.
with_scope and with_exclusive_scope
with_scope and with_exclusive_scope are now implemented on top of Relation as well. Making it possible to use any relation with them :
with_scope(where(:name => 'lifo')) do
  ...
end

Or even use a named scope :
with_exclusive_scope(Item.red) do
  ...
end

That’s all. Please open a lighthouse ticket if you find a bug or have a patch for an improvement!
UPDATE 1 : Added information about deprecating scoped_by_ dynamic methods.
UPDATE 2 : Added information about deprecating default_scope with finder options.
