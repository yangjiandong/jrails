rails 3.0 has been released. I know a number of you are excited about all of the possibilities. Along with the release of Rails is a new point release of JRuby.  So the big question is how do you use them together.

The default Rails environment uses SQLite as the database. Let me show you how to get started.

Riding on JRuby on Rails

Start by downloading JRuby, and install it.
Once it is installed you will want to install jruby-openssl.
jruby -S gem install jruby-openssl
Next lets install the SQLite database gems.
jruby -S gem install jdbc-sqlite3 activerecord-jdbc-adapter \
activerecord-jdbcsqlite3-adapter
Once we have installed the gems for SQLite, we can install Rails.
jruby -S gem install rails mongrel warbler
Now that Rails is installed, we can create our example application. This will create our application.
jruby -S rails new blog
Next we replace the following line in the Gemfile

gem 'sqlite3-ruby', :require => 'sqlite3'

with the following:

if defined?(JRUBY_VERSION)
gem 'jdbc-sqlite3'
gem 'activerecord-jdbc-adapter'
gem 'activerecord-jdbcsqlite3-adapter'
gem 'jruby-openssl'
gem 'jruby-rack'
gem 'warbler'
else
gem 'sqlite3-ruby', :require => 'sqlite3'
end

This allows us to run the application in JRuby, or Ruby.
Next we need to modify the config/database.yml file.

# SQLite version 3.x
# gem install sqlite3-ruby (not necessary on OS X Leopard)
development:
adapter: jdbcsqlite3
database: db/development.sqlite3
pool: 5
timeout: 5000

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
test:
adapter: jdbcsqlite3
database: db/test.sqlite3
pool: 5
timeout: 5000

production:
adapter: jdbcsqlite3
database: db/production.sqlite3
pool: 5
timeout: 5000

Next we need to migrate the database.
jruby -S rake db:migrate
Finally we can start our new Rails 3 application.
jruby -S rails server
That's it. You are riding on Rails in 9 steps.
