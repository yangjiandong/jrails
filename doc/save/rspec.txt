   1. jruby -S gem install rspec-rails --no-rdoc --no-ri

This version of rspec-rails only works with versions of rails >= 3.0.0

To configure your app to use rspec-rails, add a declaration to your Gemfile.
If you are using Bundler's grouping feature in your Gemfile, be sure to include
rspec-rails in the :development group as well as the :test group so that you
can access its generators and rake tasks.

  group :development, :test do
    gem "rspec-rails", ">= 2.0.1"
  end

Be sure to run the following command in each of your Rails apps if you're
upgrading:

  script/rails generate rspec:install

Even if you've run it before, this ensures that you have the latest updates
to spec/spec_helper.rb and any other support files.

Beta versions of rspec-rails-2 installed files that are no longer being used,
so please remove these files if you have them:

  lib/tasks/rspec.rake
  config/initializers/rspec_generator.rb

Lastly, be sure to look at Upgrade.markdown to see what might have changed
since the last release.
